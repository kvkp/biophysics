Biological Physics
==================

This is the repository for Dr. Kinder's biophysics course.

If you are taking the course, you should ___fork___ this repository.  You will be able to edit the files in your own fork, but not the files in this repository.

Each week, there will be a new folder with Jupyter notebooks, data sets, and code samples.  Update your fork to bring the new content in each week.  Be sure to commit your work by the due date.

Week 1
------

The assigned coding problems for this week are 1.2 and 1.5.  Please do your work in these notebooks.


Week 2
------

The assigned coding problems for this week are 3.2 and 3.4.  Please do your work in these notebooks.  You should also work through Computer Lab 1 (Chapter 5) of _A Student's Guide to Python_.  You can store your work in the Jupyter notebook, or write a script to complete the assignment.  If you write a script, save it in the `week-02/` folder.

Week 3
------

No new coding assignment.


Week 4
